# Goose Web Interface - Implementation Complete

## What's Fixed

The `goose web` command now works exactly like `goose session`:

1. **Proper Configuration Loading**
   - Loads provider and model from your `goose configure` settings
   - Loads and enables all configured extensions
   - Uses the current working directory (just like CLI)

2. **Full Feature Parity**
   - Tool execution (shell commands, file editing, etc.)
   - Streaming responses
   - Context management with auto-summarization
   - Error handling
   - Extension support

## Usage

```bash
# Start web server (uses current directory as working directory)
goose web

# Start on specific port
goose web --port 8080

# Start and open browser
goose web --open

# Bind to all interfaces (be careful!)
goose web --host 0.0.0.0
```

## What You Can Do

Everything you can do in the CLI:
- Run shell commands
- Edit files
- Ask questions
- Generate code
- Use any configured extensions

## Example Prompts to Test

1. "List all files in the current directory"
2. "Create a Python script that prints hello world"
3. "What's in the README.md file?"
4. "Run `ls -la` and show me the output"

## Key Differences from CLI

- **Auto-approval**: Tool confirmations are auto-approved (shows a note)
- **Session**: Each browser tab gets its own in-memory session
- **No persistence**: Sessions aren't saved to disk

The web interface now provides a fully functional Goose experience in your browser!
