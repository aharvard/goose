A Day in the Life of a Forgetful Goldfish

In a tank with rocks, and plants that sway,  
Lives a goldfish named Gus, who swims every day.  
He blinks at the glass, peeks behind a fake log,  
Forgets in an instant his love for a blog.  

A nugget of gold with a memory so short,  
He circles the castle, the bubbler, and fort.  
Every lap's a new journey, fresh as the sun,  
"Where am I now? This is so much fun!"  

He greets a fake squid with a merry "Hello!"  
Three seconds later, his brain hits a "No!"  
It’s a magic each moment, his world’s a surprise,  
A plastic sea monster can still hypnotize.  

So here's to Gus, with a view that’s brand new,  
In a line his own track he will never pursue.  
With a swish and a splash, he repeats his fun wish,  
Long live the life of a goldfish named Fish!
