# Goose Web Interface - Session Handling & Cancel Fix

## Session Handling Confirmation

Yes, the web interface works with **proper session management** just like `goose session`:

1. **One Agent Instance**: A single Goose agent is created when the server starts, shared across all connections
2. **Per-Tab Sessions**: Each browser tab gets its own session (identified by a unique `session_id`)
3. **Message History**: Messages are accumulated in each session, maintaining conversation context
4. **Same Working Directory**: Uses the current directory where `goose web` was run, just like CLI

## Cancel Button Fix

### The Problem
The cancel button was staying in "Cancel" mode even after operations completed because we weren't sending a completion signal.

### The Solution
Added a `complete` message type that's sent when:
- All streaming is finished
- The response is fully processed
- It's time to reset the UI

### Message Flow
1. User sends message → Button changes to "Cancel"
2. Goose processes and streams responses
3. When done → Server sends `complete` message
4. Frontend receives `complete` → Button resets to "Send"

## How Sessions Work

```
Browser Tab 1 (session_abc123)     Browser Tab 2 (session_xyz789)
         ↓                                    ↓
    WebSocket Connection              WebSocket Connection
         ↓                                    ↓
    Session Messages:                 Session Messages:
    - User: "Hello"                   - User: "List files"
    - Assistant: "Hi there!"          - Assistant: "Here are..."
    - User: "What's 2+2?"             - User: "Create test.py"
    - Assistant: "4"                  - Assistant: "Created..."
         ↓                                    ↓
    Same Goose Agent (with loaded extensions, provider, etc.)
         ↓
    Current Working Directory (where `goose web` was run)
```

## Key Points

- **Isolated Sessions**: Each tab maintains its own conversation history
- **Shared Agent**: All sessions use the same configured agent with loaded extensions
- **Proper Cleanup**: Cancel operations are cleaned up per session
- **Streaming Support**: Responses stream in real-time with proper completion handling

The web interface now provides a fully functional Goose experience with proper session isolation and UI state management!
